"18","SPAC1002.21","was annotated as dubious but based on position in uracil regulatable operon, as this CDS does not appear to be transcribed. t is possible that the localization data is an artifact of the combination of overexpression and hydrophobicity. The protein sequence is also a strange composition, and there is no ortholog in octosporus or japonicus genomes. On balance, taking into account all of the available features and contextual information, it is unlikely that this feature codes for a bona fide protein.",""
