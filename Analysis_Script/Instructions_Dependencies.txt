BarSeqTools is a custom-built R package containing utility function to characterise the Bioneer version 5.0 of the fission yeast deletion collection library by barcode matching and visualisation.

The following R package dependencies must be available:
shiny
Gviz
S4Vectors
tats4
BiocGenerics
parallel
IRanges
GenomicRanges
GenomeInfoDb
grid
GenomicFeatures
AnnotationDbi
Biobase

In addition to having the above dependencies available and installed in R,  you must also have the following installed on your machine home directory:

1. Anaconda
    For details on how to install it, check out this link: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

2.Barcount
   A custom-built Python script used to search for the barcodes within the read using 10 base pairs flanks on either side of the barcode.
   Barcount is available to download from GitHub code page

3. Bedtools
    Install with conda install -c bioconda bedtools

4. Bowtie2
    Install with conda: conda install -c bioconda bowtie2

5. fastqCombinedPairedEnd.py 
    Python script used to filter read 2 based on the header information of read 1. 
    Read 1 header contains the barcode, thus matching read 1 barcode containing reads to their respective read 2 reads.
    The script can be downloaded from Github code page.

6. Fastq-grep
    The package is part of fastx-toolkit. 
    Install with conda: conda install -c bioconda fastq-tools

7. Fastx_trimmer
    The package is part of fastq-tools. 
    Install with conda: conda install -c biobuilds fastx-toolkit

8. Samtools
    Install with conda: conda install -c bioconda samtools 

9. PEAR 
    For details on how to install it, check out this link: https://cme.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/pear/doc.html)

10. Python
      For details on how to install it, check out this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

The following file dependencies are also required:

1. All protein coding genes in gtf file format.

2. A  bedfile format of the Bioneer library containing all the genomic coordinates and strands for all of the genes.

3. An empty csv file required to run barcount since barcount was made to run with the barcode_table argument. 
    Note, the file is not being used so it does not affect the overall result at all.

4.  The indexed S. pome genome folder.
